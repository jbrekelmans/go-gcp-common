# Introduction
A collection of Go libraries.

# Index
1. [auth/google/compute](auth/google/compute): verification of Google Compute Engine identity JSON Web Tokens (see [Google's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/verifying-instance-identity#verify_signature)). This is useful for applications that want to accept such JWTs as an authentication mechanism.
1. [cache](cache): a cache for values that need to be periodically re-evaluated where evaluations are expensive enough to justify ensuring only one Goroutine evaluates while other Goroutines wait for the evaluation. This is equivalent to using a [Mutex](https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Mutex), but this package supports a [Context](https://golang.org/pkg/context/#Context) parameter. This primitive is useful for caching remote resources such as JWKS' and authentication tokens.
1. [http](http): primitives focused around [RFC6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750). This is useful for HTTP servers that want to implement the Bearer authentication scheme.
1. [sync](sync): defines a useful function `CallInParallelReturnWhenAnyError`
1. [test](test): logrus logging in tests. For example:
    ```go
    import "github.com/jbrekelmans/go-lib/test"
    
    func Test_MyTest(t *testing.T) {
        defer test.RedirectLogs(t).Dispose()
        // Any calls that MyTest makes to logrus's standard logger are forwarded to t.Logf.
        MyTest()
    }
    ```
1. [url](url): url validation and normalization functions.
